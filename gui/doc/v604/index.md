### TGTextViewostream

- New class, the `TGTextViewostream is a text viewer widget. It is a specialization
  of `TGTextView` and `std::ostream`, and it uses a `TGTextViewStreamBuf`, which inherits
  from `std::streambuf`, allowing to stream text directly to the text view in a `cout`-
  like fashion. A new tutorial showing how to use the `TGTextViewostream` widget has
  also been added.
