## Histogram Libraries

### TGraph2DPainter

-   In some case and extra point was drawn in the center od the plot when a
    `TGRaph2d`was drawn with `P`, `P0`, or `PCOL` options.

### THistPainter

- It was possible to interactively zoom outside the histograms' limits. Protections
  have been added.
- When an histogram was drawn with the option `E0` and log scale along the Y axis,
  some additional markers were drawn at the bottom line of the plot. This was
  reported <a href="http://root.cern.ch/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=18778">here</a>.
- Implement the option `0` combined with the option `COL` as requested
  <a href="https://root.cern.ch/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=19046">here</a>.
  When the minimum of the histogram is set to a greater value than the real minimum,
  the bins having a value between the real minimum and the new minimum are not drawn
  unless the option <tt>0</tt> is set.

    Example:

    ``` {.cpp}
    {
       TCanvas *c1 = new TCanvas("c1","c1",600,600);
       c1->Divide(1,2);
       TH2F *hcol21 = new TH2F("hcol21","Option COLZ",40,-4,4,40,-20,20);
       TH2F *hcol22 = new TH2F("hcol22","Option COLZ0",40,-4,4,40,-20,20);
       Float_t px, py;
       for (Int_t i = 0; i < 25000; i++) {
          gRandom->Rannor(px,py);
          hcol21->Fill(px,5*py);
          hcol22->Fill(px,5*py);
       }
       hcol21->SetBit(TH1::kNoStats);
       hcol22->SetBit(TH1::kNoStats);
       gStyle->SetPalette(1);
       c1->cd(1); hcol21->Draw("COLZ");
       c1->cd(2); hcol22->Draw("COLZ0");
       hcol22->SetMaximum(100);
       hcol22->SetMinimum(40);
       return c1;
}
    ```

- The parameter `gStyle->SetHistTopMargin()` was ignored when plotting a 2D histogram
  using the option `E`. This can be seen plotting the histogram with `"LEGO E"`.
- GetObjectInfo did not display the right value form "Sum" for histograms plotted
  with option SAME on top of an histogram displayed with a subrange. This was
  reported in ROOT-7124.

### TGraph2D

- Change `GetHistogram()` in order to be able to access the returned histogram
  before the 2D graph has been filled with points. That was not possible previously.
  This problem was reported
 <a href="https://root.cern.ch/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=19186">here</a>.

### THStack

- Implement `GetNhists()` to return the number of histograms in the stack.
- New drawing option `NOSTACKB`. histograms are drawn next to each other as
  bar charts.

    Example:

    ``` {.cpp}
    TCanvas* nostackb() {
       TCanvas *cst0 = new TCanvas("cst0","cst0",600,400);
       THStack *hs = new THStack("hs","Stacked 1D histograms: option #font[82]{\"nostackb\"}");

       TH1F *h1 = new TH1F("h1","h1",10,-4,4);
       h1->FillRandom("gaus",20000);
       h1->SetFillColor(kRed);
       hs->Add(h1);

       TH1F *h2 = new TH1F("h2","h2",10,-4,4);
       h2->FillRandom("gaus",15000);
       h2->SetFillColor(kBlue);
       hs->Add(h2);

       TH1F *h3 = new TH1F("h3","h3",10,-4,4);
       h3->FillRandom("gaus",10000);
       h3->SetFillColor(kGreen);
       hs->Add(h3);

       hs->Draw("nostackb");
       return cst0;
    }

    ```
