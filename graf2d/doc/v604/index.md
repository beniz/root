## 2D Graphics Libraries

### TText

- The character position was not correct with the Cocoa backend.
  (see https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-6561)

### TLegend

- Use the new `TStyle` global attribute `gStyle->GetLegendTextSize()` to set the
  legend item text size. If this value is 0 and if the text size directly set on
  the `TLegend` object is also 0, then the text size is automatically computed to
  fit the legend box. If `gStyle->GetLegendTextSize()` is non equal to 0 and if
  text size  directly set on the `TLegend` object is 0, then the `gStyle` value is
  used to draw the legend text. If the text size directly set on the `TLegend`
  object is not null, then it is used to draw the legend text.

### TTexDump

- The hollow fill style was not rendered correctly.
  (see https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-6841)
- Better line width matching with screen and pdf output.
- Text color was ignored. It was always black.
- Text color was ignored. It was always black.
- The underscore `_` produced an error outside the TeX math context.
- Fix an issue with transparent pads.

### TPostScript

- Small fix for fill patterns 1, 2 and 3.
- With `TMathtext`, only the fonts really used are now loaded in the PostScript
  file. Typically it reduces the file size by a factor 10 (compare to the previous
  implementation) for normal plots with math formulae and greek characters.

### TPDF

- When a text size was equal or smaller than 0 the PDF file was corrupted.
- Small fix for fill patterns 1, 2 and 3.

### TSVG

- Use float numbers instead of integer to describe graphics paths to avoid
  rounding problems.
- Implement missing math symbols.

### TPad

- In `TPad::ShowGuidelines` the number of guide lines is limited to 15. Above
  that they become useless.
- Print a warning if one of the pad limit is a NaN.
- In `Pad::Print()`, make sure the file format is "pdf" when the option "Title:"
  is present.

### TLatex

- With the Cocoa backend the PDF and PS output produced miss-aligned exponents
  because the `GetTextExtend` method behaved differently in batch mode and "screen"
  mode. This is now fixed. See http://root.cern.ch/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=18883
- Improve the square-root drawing in case it is small.
